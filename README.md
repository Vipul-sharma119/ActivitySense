ActivitySense is a productivity tracking tool that helps in collecting user activity data for training machine learning models. It opens a dialog for the user to add a task, then begins tracking mouse movement and keyboard presses in the background. All activity data is logged and saved in a CSV file, making it suitable for behavioral analysis and building intelligent productivity prediction models.
